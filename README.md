# Matrix Pmod&trade; compatible module

Matrix is a simple 4x4 LED matrix module with a 12-pin Pmod&trade; compatible header.

This repo contains schematics, pinouts and example gateware.

Find more information on the [Matrix product page](https://machdyne.com/product/matrix-led-pmod/).

## Hello World Example

Building the example requires [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys), [nextpnr-ice40](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) and [IceStorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm).

Assuming they are installed, you can simply type `make` to build the gateware, which will be written to output/matrix.bin. This example targets the Kr√∂te FPGA board but can be easily adapted to any FPGA board with a 12-pin PMOD connector.
